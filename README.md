# Islamic Prayer Center

The Islamic Prayer Center is a social forum website providing a range of services for Muslims. Users visiting this site can access various Islamic information, including prayer timings and more. This website was created to practice using Next.js, facing minor challenges during the initial stages as it's the first Next.js project. The project is built using Next.js, Next Auth for authentication, Tailwind CSS for styling, and MongoDB for data management.

## Features

- **Service Diversity**: Offers social services, accurate prayer timings according to specific zones, and a collection of Islamic articles and blogs.
- **Robust Authentication**: Ensures secure user authentication through Next Auth.
- **Page Generation Types**: Some pages are statically rendered as HTML, while others are server-side renders at runtime. Pages are automatically generated as static HTML + JSON using `getStaticProps`.
